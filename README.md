# 💼 User Management System (Internship Project)

A *secure, role-based user management system* built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB — developed during my *Cybersecurity Internship. The system supports **Admin and User login*, includes access control, vulnerability testing (ZAP), logging (Winston), and follows modern security practices.
